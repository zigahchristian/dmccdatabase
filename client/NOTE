### Core Features:

1. **Question Bank**:

   - Include a database of questions and answers for various topics.
   - Each question should have multiple-choice answers.
   - Randomize question order each time a user begins a quiz.

2. **Scoring System**:

   - Award points for correct answers and provide real-time score updates.
   - Display the userâ€™s final score and encourage replays for better results.

3. **Feedback Mechanism**:

   - Inform users if their answer is correct or incorrect.
   - Show the correct answer when the user gets a question wrong.

4. **Quiz Timer (Optional)**:

   - Add an optional timer for each question or for the entire quiz.
   - Provide a time-out message if the timer runs out, and move to the next question.

5. **Progress Tracking**:

   - Show the number of questions answered out of the total.
   - Offer a summary at the end, showing the correct/incorrect answers and score.

6. **User Interface and Visual Design**:
   - Clean and responsive layout with clear, accessible fonts.

### Technical Requirements:

1. **Platform**: MIT App Inventor.
2. **Programming Logic**: Use blocks-based logic to handle scoring, random question selection, feedback, and navigation.
3. **Data Storage**:
   - Questions and answers should be stored either in a local database or an online database accessible via API.
4. **UI Components**:
   - Buttons, Labels, List Pickers, Timers, and Notifications.

### Timeline:

**Estimated Completion Time**: 3-4 weeks.

1. **Week 1**: Design UI layouts, set up question bank, basic navigation.
2. **Week 2**: Implement scoring, feedback mechanism, and timer function.
3. **Week 3**: Add progress tracking and score summary screens.
4. **Week 4**: Test, refine UI, and debug.
